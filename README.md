# [Project 1: Predicting NBA Players 2K21 Ratings](https://github.com/Hustonb/Predicting-NBA-Players-2K21-Ratings)
This repository contains files associated with the "Predicting NBA Playersâ€™ 2K21 Ratings" project worked on by Ben Huston and Eli Standard. This project was made as part of a 6 week long open ended project for an introductory Data Science course at UVM.

The purpose of the included "Predicting NBA Player's 2K21 Ratings" writeup was to share our findings; and act as an overview of the technical details that went into reaching those conclusions. Note that only the "Predicting NBA Player's 2K21 Ratings" PDF was intended as a finished product. The other files are included as a zip file which is intended to show (via a Jupyter notebook) the step by step process we followed; and allow anyone it interests to run this code for themself. Note yet again that this Jupyter notebook (IPYNB file) isn't well polished and just serves as a demonstration of  the methods we used. If you want to look over this Jupyter Notebook, extract the zip to a folder and then run the IPYNB file.

# [Project 2: 2019 Spending's Impact on USA Olympic Performance](https://github.com/Hustonb/2019-Spending-s-Impact-on-USA-Olympic-Performance)
The information presented can be used to study the spending of the USOPC and specific NGBs in 2019 and team USA's subsequent 2020 Olympic performance. The financial report (top half) and performance report (bottom half) give insight into what sort of spending led to success at the games. Cumulative values are shown by default, but use the NGB selector to view data about specific programs.

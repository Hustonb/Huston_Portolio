# Project 1: Predicting NBA Players 2K21 Ratings
This repository contains files associated with the "Predicting NBA Playersâ€™ 2K21 Ratings" project worked on by Ben Huston and Eli Standard. This project was made as part of a 6 week long open ended project for an introductory Data Science course at UVM.

The purpose of the included "Predicting NBA Player's 2K21 Ratings" writeup was to share our findings; and act as an overview of the technical details that went into reaching those conclusions. Note that only the "Predicting NBA Player's 2K21 Ratings" PDF was intended as a finished product. The other files are included as a zip file which is intended to show (via a Jupyter notebook) the step by step process we followed; and allow anyone it interests to run this code for themself. Note yet again that this Jupyter notebook (IPYNB file) isn't well polished and just serves as a demonstration of  the methods we used. If you want to look over this Jupyter Notebook, extract the zip to a folder and then run the IPYNB file.

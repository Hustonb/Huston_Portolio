# [Project 1: Predicting NBA Players 2K21 Ratings](https://github.com/Hustonb/Predicting-NBA-Players-2K21-Ratings)
Went through the full data science lifecycle with the goal of creating a multiple linear reression model which predicts NBA players NBA 2k21 ratings given their real NBA statistics. 
1. Scraped and combined data from multiple messy sources, using Python's Beautiful Soup library. 
2. Performed exensive cleaning, leveraging methods ranging from more common to advanced regular expressions.
3. Created numerous visualizations to help draw insights from the data, leveraging Matplotlib, seaborn, and NumPy.
4. Trained multiple linear regression models to peform necessary prediction: leveraging scikit-learn package.
5. Evaluated models using R-squared value, validation error, and residual plots.
6. Leveraged permutation testing and hypothesis testing to evaluate feature importance.
7. Documented conclusions and future work to be done.

# [Project 2: SQL Competency and Visualization of Sales Data.](https://github.com/Hustonb/SQL-Competency-and-Visualization-Sales-Data)
This project showcases my proficiency in SQL for database design and exploratory data analysis, as well as my data visualization skills in Tableau.
1. Designed database schema to fit customer needs.
2. Generated sample data using AI tools to populate the Orders, Customers, and Storage tables (Product table records were provided by customer).
3. Created SQL database in MySQL, and inserted records.
4. Performed EDA in SQL to demonstrate SQL proficiency and gain insight into customer's questions.
5. Created Tableau dashboard to visualize KPIs and trend.

The end result can be viewed here:

# [Project 3: Data Cleaning and Pipeline Creation, NBA Play-by-Play Data.](https://github.com/Hustonb/Data-Cleaning-and-Pipeline-Creation-NBA-Play-by-Play-Data)
This project showcases my proficiency in data cleaning and ETL pipeline creation using Python: specifically the Pandas library.

The motivating question behind this project was what are the most efficient types of shots in basketball. The secondary question/goal was to build a profile of the shots (whether it be the shot distance, shot type, etc.) that teams in the NBA take. This is first and foremost a data cleaning project, and the majority of the work will be done preparing the data to answer these questions; with a secondary focus on exploring the questions themselves (which have already been researched in depth).

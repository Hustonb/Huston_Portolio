# [Project 1: Predicting NBA Players 2K21 Ratings](https://github.com/Hustonb/Predicting-NBA-Players-2K21-Ratings)
Went through the full data science lifecycle with the goal of creating a multiple linear reression model which predicts NBA players NBA 2k21 ratings given their real NBA statistics. 
1. Scraped and combined data from multiple messy sources, using Python's Beautiful Soup library. 
2. Performed exensive cleaning, leveraging methods ranging from more common to advanced regular expressions.
3. Created numerous visualizations to help draw insights from the data, leveraging Matplotlib, seaborn, and NumPy.
4. Trained multiple linear regression models to peform necessary prediction.
5. Evaluated models using R-squared value, validation error, and residual plots.
6. Leveraged permutation testing and hypothesis testing to evaluate feature importance.
7. Documented conclusions and future work to be done.

# [Project 2: SQL Competency and Visualization of Sales Data.](https://github.com/Hustonb/SQL-Competency-and-Visualization-Sales-Data)
The information presented can be used to study the spending of the USOPC and specific NGBs in 2019 and team USA's subsequent 2020 Olympic performance. The financial report (top half) and performance report (bottom half) give insight into what sort of spending led to success at the games. Cumulative values are shown by default, but use the NGB selector to view data about specific programs.
